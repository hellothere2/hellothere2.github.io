  <h1>Political Science Terms</h1>
  <dl>
    <dt>Descriptive Question</dt>
    <dd>How things are. I.e. is this true? What is this?</dd>
    <dt>Explanatory Question</dt>
    <dd>Why things are the way they are. I.e. Why do third world areas produce so many refugees? Hoe is power gained and held?</dd>
    <dt>Normative Question</dt>
    <dd>How things <i>should</i> be. What is the proper or just response to this?</dd>

<dt>Politics</dt>
    <dd>The definition of politics is a contested term, although it usually refers to formal government activity. But politics is much more than just government activity. Politics can encompass all aspects of conflict and cooperation, with Ancient Greek philosophers arguing that human beings are political in nature. Some aspects of politics are: collective action, conflict and cooperation, authoritative decisions, and enforcement. Politics is also commonly defined as conflict resolution.</dd>
    <dt>The State</dt>
    <dd>The State is a territorial community with a centralized governing authority. This community has sovereignty over itself, including a monopoly of 'legitimate' violence.</dd>
    <dt>Organizational approach to the State</dt>
    <dd>The Organizational approach defines the State as a specific set of institutions: Bureaucracy, military, police, courts, etc. But the organizational approach fails to answer why these institutions are collectively the state? <br>
    After Hegel, political scientists rejected the concept of a state as unnecessary and useless. <br>
    The organizational approach typically defines the State under the following topics:
    Territorial – the state is a demarcated area with defensible borders. People – the state is a community defined by territorial boundaries. Sovereignty – The state is the institution with final and absolute authority within territory. The state might also be public institutions and roles. Domination – The State is whatever has monopoly of violence within a territory (Max Weber). Legitimacy – makes domination easier to swallow. <br> International perspective adds new aspects to the State: Effective government, relations with other states, and a blurred line between the international and the internal state.</dd>
    <dt>Government</dt>
    <dd>Government is the activity of governing or ruling. Governing is the act of exercising authority over others. Governments are the institutions responsible for coordinating collective decisions.</dd>

    <dt>Aristotle's Government Classification System</dt>
    <dd>Aristotle, arguably the first Western political scientist, defined government through asking two questions. First, who rules? And second, in whose interests?
<table>

<tr>
<td>Who rules?</td>
<td>One</td>
<td>Few</td>
<td>Many</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ruling in the ruler's interests</td>
<td>Tyranny</td>
<td>Oligarchy</td>
<td>Democracy</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ruling in everyone's interests</td>
<td>Monarchy</td>
<td>Aristocracy</td>
<td>Polity</td>
</tr>

</table>

While Aristotle believed that an Aristocracy was the best form of government in theory, he believed that Polity was the best choice, since if it were corrupted, Democracy was the least harmful form of government.</dd>
<dt>Power</dt>
<dd>The ability to produce results and influence others' behaviour. Power can take several forms: coercion, influence, and manipulation.</dd>
<dt>Hard Power</dt>
<dd>The Carrot and The Stick. An example of the stick is force and coercion, often through military intervention. And example of the carrot is economic inducement.</dd>
<dt>Soft Power</dt>
<dd>Attraction and agenda setting. Getting others to want what you want. Ex: institions, values, policies</dd>
<dt>Authority</dt>
<dd>The right to command. It is legitimate power, and the right to punish those who disobey.</dd>
<dt>The State of Nature</dt>
<dd>The State of Nature refers to a point in history before man became civilized. Before government was formed. It is the hypothetical state of human purity. Hobbes, John Locke, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau are the primary classical political science authors on this topic.</dd>
<dt>Political Obligation</dt>
<dd>The obligation to obey the law simply because it is the law.</dd>
<dt>Thomas Hobbes</dt>
<dd>Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679) was a philosopher who wrote Leviathan (1651) and Behemoth (1697), two extremely influential works of political science and philosophy.</dd>
<dt>Anarchism</dt>
<dd>Defined literally (an + archos) = without rulers. Anarchists believe we would be better off without government. Cooperation is beneficial, so it tends to emerge through evolution.
 </dd>
 <dt>Voluntarism</dt>
 <dd>The idea that the State’s political authority (and therefore legitimacy) depends on the consent of the ruled.</dd>
 <dt>The Social Contract</dt>
 <dd>Political obligation is based on contract or agreement. This agreement can be explicit or implicit.</dd>
 <dt>Tacit Consent</dt>
 <dd>Regarding the Social Contract - Implicit or understood consent. Is there something that is at least morally equivalent to consent? Residence in a country can be argued as counting as consent. Staying is morally equivalent to consenting, because dissatisfied people can leave. But there are obstacles to leaving: poverty, culture, language, other states – so therefore, residence is not morally equivalent to consenting.</dd>
 <dt>Hypothetical Consent</dt>
 <dd>Regarding the Social Contract - rational individuals would consent to government if they were in the state of nature. This is not voluntarism because the state is worthy of your consent. Hypothetical consent gets us to realize what we already consent to. Objection: it’s not really consent, plus some still might refuse to consent.</dd>
 <dt>Locke's Solution to the Social Contract and Consent</dt>
 <dd>We have two choices:<br>
  1. We can have a publicly agreed, shared set of laws <br>
  2. We can defer to private judgements about the content of laws.<br>
Locke concludes that it’s better to have shared laws than continued disagreement, since the disagreements would inevitably lead to conflict. The “inconveniences” of government defeat anarchism.
</dd>

<dt>Hegelian Idealism</dt>
<dd>Hegelian Idealism, named after the philosopher Georg Willhelm Friedrich Hegel, sees history as the gradual fulfillment of human consciousness. We start with the family ‘Particular Altruism’, completely private. The next development is Civil Society which consists of Universal Egoism. The final development is the State which consists of Universal Altruism. The state is seen as the end of history, as it is the fulillment of the human conciousness.</dd>

<dt>Functionalism</dt>
<dd>Functionalism is essentially the belief that you get what you need. Since political institutions exist, we need them. The state is a provider of Order and Stability. So all you need to do is figure out what threatens order.</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt>Comparative Politics</dt>
    <dd>A division within the study of Political Science which considers states as units of analysis. It compares states and studies politics under state-provided order.</dd>




</dl>
   
   <dl>
<dt>International Relations</dt>
<dd>A division within the study of Political Science which studies what is outside of the state. International Relations examines states acting within a system of states, examining state interactions in the absence of rules and enforcement. International relations begins with the concept of states acting within an anarchy, but has recently come to discover and explore surprising sources of order within the international community. In international relations, states are formally equal, althrough highly unequal in capacity.</dd>



<dt>Autarky</dt>
<dd>In statesmancraft, the pursuit of self-sufficience/self-reliance/self-sustainablity.</dd>

<dt>Supraterritoriality</dt>
<dd>Transcending state boundaries</dd>

<dt>Globalization</dt>
<dd>A complex process of integration and interconnection leading towards a “borderless world”. A move to a single global market, culture, society, and political order.
  Globalization is not new. We have experienced centuries of global exchange, exploration, and empire building.<br>Modern expansions: Marx predicted globalization via greedy bourgeoisie and imperialism. 1870-1914 commercial and financial interconnections were intensified.<br>

Deglobalization occurred during WW1 and 2. The opposing sides did not trade with each other and engaged in interwar protectionism - all resources were diverted to the war effort instead of trade. Globalization gradually re-emerged in the 50s and 60s with trade liberalization, financial integration, and US leadership of the free world. Two major developments since then have been the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 which opened it up to trade, and China's implementation of capitalism in the Special Economic Zones.<br>


We’re not ‘one world’ yet. The global economy is not yet completely integrated. There is cultural backlash and indigenization. States remain crucial players. Globalization is a multi-faceted, open ended process.<br>

<dt>Economic Globalization</dt>
<dd>The intensification of translational flows of goods, services, labor, and capital, challenging economic sovereignty.</dd>
<dt>Cultural Globalization</dt>
<dd>The diffusion of information, ideas, and images, spread through improved communications technology. Reduces the distinctiveness of national cultures</dd>
<dt>Political Globalization</dt>
<dd>The reduced ability of states to manage their own affairs. Usually encompasses the enhanced importance of organizations above states (ie EU), bigger roles for subnational bodies (regions and cities) as opposed to the State, and States one part of a complex multilevel system.
</dd>
</dd>

<dt>Globalization Crisis</dt>
<dd>Global capitalism is currently in crisis due to the deregulation of financial sector, sale of increasingly risky and poorly understood financial products, and the US housing crisis. Financial global integration spread the effects of the housing crisis across the globe.<br>
The response to the stock market crash demonstrates that globalization still hasn't quite taken hold, since response to the crisis was mainly national, involving: bank bailouts, stimulus programs (Kenyes), and austerity cutback spending.<br></dd>
</dl> 

<dl>
<dt>Multilevel Politics</dt>
<dd>Multilevel Politics is the study of the space within states (national, provincial, local) and the space beyond states (transnational regions, global order), and political interactions across these levels.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
<dt>Political Economy</dt>
<dd>Politics and the economy are interrelated. Economy influences political outcomes, but politics also influences economic outcomes through organizing the economy and realizign social values. Economy and politics are embedded within each other. The discipline of political economy emerged with the spread and strengthening of markets in the early 18th century, and the study of implications for politics and society through the works of Adam Smith, David Ricardo, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, etc.</dd>

<dt>State Centric Political Economy</dt>
<dd>Followers of this school of thought in political economy believe that markets are not natural, they are man-made. State formation inspired state intervention in markets.
<dt>Mercantilism</dt>
<dd>A subset of State Centric Political Economy, Mercantilists believe that the purpose of the state is to increase national wealth and power.</dd>
<dt>Protectionism</dt>
<dd>Aptly summarized by the phrase "beggar thy neighbor". Protectionisms believe that there is a set amount of wealth in the world, which is divided between states. There are only so many slices of the pie to go around.</dd>
    </dd>
    <dt>Classical Political Economy</dt>
    <dd>Followers of this school of thought in political economy believe that markets are natural and spontaneous. Markets are inclined toward efficiency and equilibrium, and are great communicators. Therefore, it's best if markets are largely left alone (Laissez-faire). Economics are the basis for an improved science of society itself. Classical Political Economy is best demonstrated through the work of Adam Smith's On the Wealth of Nations.</dd>
    <dt>Neoclassical Political Economy</dt>
    <dd>Followers of this school of thought in political economy believe that economics is a mathematical sciece. Economy is much less political than we thought, and is clearly distinct from political science. Neoclassical Political Economists are eager to offer the concept of the 'market man' as a model citizen.</dd>
    <dt>Marxist Political Economy</dt>
    <dd>Followers of this school of thought in political economy believe that Capitalism is exploitative, internally contradictory, and prone to revolution by a class-concious proletariat. They also believe that history is defined by class warfare, and can be seperated into stages defined by economy. The works of Karl Marx and Freidrich Engels are essential to Marxist thought.</dd>


    <dt>Enterprise Capitalism</dt>
    <dd>Enterprise Capitalism is a Liberal form of economy. It emphasises a small state, labor flexibility, and a self-regulating market. Best example: USA.</dd>

    <dt>Social Capitalism</dt>
    <dd>Social Capitalism is a Conservative form of economy. It emphasises a free market, but a society that is protected against market effects, and a 'social partnership' through trade unions, etc. Best example: Germany.</dd>

    <dt>State Capitalism</dt>
    <dd>State Capitalism is a Neo-Mercantalist form of economy. In State Capitalism, the state directs social partners. It directly picks the 'winners' of the market, and in some cases entirely replaces the market. Best example: Japan and now arguably China.</dd>
