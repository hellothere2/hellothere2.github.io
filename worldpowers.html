								<h2>Elections</h2>
							</header>
							<p>Elections are a mechanism through which politicians can be accountable and forced to reflect public opinion. There are a few central functions of elections: recruiting politicians, making governments, providing representation, influencing policy, educating voters, building legitimacy, and strengthening elites.<br>
							An electoral system is a set of rules that governs the conduct of elections. These rules are the subject of political debate.<br>
							When most people think of democracy, they're actually thinking of Representative Democracy - a democracy where the electorate participates in an indirect form of democratic rule by choosing who will represent their interests in the government. This is the dominant form of democracy today, implemented from America, to Germany, to Japan. There's also Direcy Democracy, where citizens vote directly on each individual policy, and Hybrid Democracy.<br>
							I don't want to get into the nitty gritty of Political Science theory about elections on this page. This is more of a brief overview. You can do some wikipedia searches on your own if you want more detail, or better yet, read a book? So for the purposes of brevity, the whole idea of an election is to determine who represents you in democracy. There's no agreed theory of representation. Instead, there's four big ones:<br>
							<ul><li>Trusteeship</li>
							<li>Delegation</li>
							<li>Mandate</li>
							<li>Resemblance</li></ul>
							</p>
							<h3>Key Terms</h3>
							<p>Representiation: Where a group or an individual stands for/acts on behalf of a larger body of people.<br>
							Mandate: An instruction or command from a higher body that demands compliance. In elections, this refers to the idea that a winning party has been given the authority to carry out their election promises in government policies.<br>
							Trustee: A person who is vested with formal (and usually legal) responsibilities for another's property and affairs.<br>
							Delegate: A person who is chosen to act for another on the basis of clear guidance and instruction; delegates do not think for themselves.<br>
							Altruism: A concern for the welfare of others, based on either enlightened self-interest or a recognition of a common humanity.<br>
							Initiative: A type of referendum through which the public is able to raise legislative proposals.<br>
							Recall: A process whereby the electorate can call unsatisfactory public officials to account and ultimately remove them.<br>
							Popular Sovereignty: The principle that there's no higher authority than the will of the people.<br>
							Manifesto: A document outlining the policies or programme a party will pursue if elected.<br>
							Descriptive representation: A model of representation that takes account of the characteristics of politicians, based on the idea that they should be a representative sample of larger society.<br>
							Plurality: The largest number out of a collection of numbers. Not necessarily an absolute majority.<br>
							Proportionality: The degree to which the allocation of seats among parties reflects the distribution of the popular vote.</p>



							<h3>Single-member plurality system (SMP), AKA First Past the Post (FPTP)</h3>
							<p>Used in: The UK (House of Commons), the USA, Canada, and India.<br>
							Type: Majoritarian<br>
							<ul>Features:
							<li>The country is divided into single-member constituencies (usually of equal size)</li>
							<li>Voters select a single candidate. Typically this involves marking their name with an x on the ballot paper.</li>
							<li>The winning candidate only needs to get a plurality of votes (first past the post)</li></ul></p>

							<p><ul>Advantages:
							<li>Establishes a clear link between representatives and constituents in which constituency duties are carried out.</li>
							<li>Offers the electorate a clear choice of potential government parties.</li>
							<li>Allows governments to be formed with a clear mandate, albeit often on the basis of plurality support</li>
							<li>Keeps extremism at bay by making it difficult for small radical parties to gain seats and credibility (Trump election puts this point into question).</li>
							<li>It makes for strong and effective government in that a single party usually has majority control of the assembly.</li>
							<li>Promotes stability because single-party governments rarely collapse from disunity and internal friction.</li>
							</ul>
							</p>
							<p><ul>Disadvantages:
							<li>The system wastes most votes (votes cast for losing candidates and votes cast for winners who are already over the plurality).</li>
							<li>Distorts electoral preferences by under representing small parties and ones with geographically evenly distributed support (the third party effect).</li>
							<li>Offers limited choice because its tendency for two major parties</li>
							<li>Undermines government legitimacy because governments often enjoy only minority support, producing a system of plurality rule (Trump is a great example of this).</li>
							<li>It creates instability because a change in government can lead to a radical shift in policies and direction.</li>
							<li>Leads to unaccountable government because the legislature is usually beneath the executive, since majority of its members are supporters of the governing party.</li>
							<li>Discourages the selection of a socially broad spread of candidates in favour of those who are attractive to a large body of voters.</li>
							</ul>



							<h3>Second Ballot System</h3>
							<p>Used in: France, presidential elections in Austria, Chile, and Russia.<br>
							Type: Majoritarian<br>
							<ul>Features:
							<li>Single candidate constituencies and single-choice voting like in the SMP system.</li>
							<li>To win on the first ballot, a candidate needs an overall majority of the votes cast.</li>
							<li>If nobody has a majority in the first ballot, a second round is held between the top two candidates.</li></ul></p>

							<p><ul>Advantages:
							<li>Broadens electoral choice</li>
							<li>Candidates can only win with majority support so they're encouraged to appeal as broadly as possible.</li>
							<li>Strong and stable government is possible similar to SMP systems.</li>
							</ul>
							</p>
							<p><ul>Disadvantages:
							<li>Little more proportional than SMP elections - distorts preferences and is unfair to third parties.</li>
							<li>Runoff candidates are encouraged to abandon principles for short term popularity or as a result of deals with defeated candidates.</li>
							<li>A second ballot can strain voter patience and interest.</li>
							</ul>
							</p>



							<h3>Alternative Vote (AV) and Supplementary Vote (SV) system</h3>
							<p>Used in: Australia (House of Representatives, AV) and the UK (London mayor, SV).<br>
							Type: Majoritarian<br>
							<ul>Features:
							<li>Single member constituencies</li>
							<li>In AV, voters rank the candidates in order of preference: 1 for their first preference, 2 for their second, etc. In SV, there is also preferential voting but there is only a single supplementary vote (you can only rank your first and second choice).</li>
							<li>Winning candidates must gain 50% of all the votes cast</li>
							<li>Votes are counted according to first preference. If no candidate reaches 50%, the bottom candidate is eliminated and their votes are redistributed according to subsequent preferences. This continues until one candidate has a majority. In SV, all canidates drop out except the top two.</li></ul></p>

							<p><ul>Advantages:
							<li>Fewer wasted votes compared to SMP.</li>
							<li>The outcome can't be influenced by deals made between candidates.</li>
							<li>Although winning candidates must get at least 50%, single party majority government isn't ruled out.</li>
							</ul>
							</p>
							<p><ul>Disadvantages:
							<li>Not much more proportional than the SMP system and is still biased to large parties.</li>
							<li>The outcome can be determined by the preferences of voters who support small (possibly extremist) parties.</li>
							<li>Winners will enjoy little first-preference support and simply be the least popular candidate.</li>
							</ul>
							</p>



							<h3>Mixed-Member Proportional (MMP) and Additional Member System (AMS)</h3>
							<p>Used in: Germany, Italy, New Zealand, the UK (Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly).<br>
							Type: Proportional<br>
							<ul>Features:
							<li>A proportion of seats are filled by the SMP system using single-member constituencies. For example, 50% in Germany.</li>
							<li>Remaining seats are filled using the party list system.</li>
							<li>Winning candidates must gain 50% of all the votes cast</li>
							<li>Electors cast two votes: one for a candidate in the constituency election, and the other for a party.</li></ul></p>

							<p><ul>Advantages:
							<li>Hybrid system balances constituency representation with election fairness.</li>
							<li>Party list process ensures that the whole assembly is proportionally representative.</li>
							<li>Although it's a proportional system, it still allows for a single party government.</li>
							<li>Allows for electors to choose constituent reps from one party and support another party for government.</li>
							<li>Takes into account that representing vonstituents and holding ministerial office are different jobs that require different talents and experience.</li>
							</ul>
							</p>
							<p><ul>Disadvantages:
							<li>Single member constituencies prevents high proportionality.</li>
							<li>Creates 2 classes of reps. One is plagued by insecurity and constituent duties, while the other is higher status and could potentially hold a ministerial position.</li>
							<li>Constituencies are generally larger (usually 2x as big as SMP) in these systems, so representation in those areas suffers.</li>
							<li>Increased party centralization and power. Parties decide who gets security from being on the list and also the order of candidates on the list itself.</li>
							</ul>
							</p>


							<h3>Single-Transferable Vote System (STV)</h3>
							<p>Used in: Ireland and the UK (North Ireland Assembly)<br>
							Type: Proportional <br>
							<ul>Features:
							<li>Multi member constituencies, usually returning 3-8 members.</li>
							<li>Parties put as many candidates as there are seats to fill.</li>
							<li>Preferential voting like the AV system.</li>
							<li>Candidates are elected if they achieve quota. This is the minimum number of votes needed to collect the stipulated number of candidates, calculated according to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droop_quota">Droop formula</a>. For example, if 100,000 votes are cast in a constituency that elects four members, the quota is 100,000/(4+1) + 1 = 20,001.</li>
							<li>The votes are counted according to firest preferences. If not all seats are filled, the bottom candidate is eliminated and their votes are redistributed according to subsequent preferences.</li></ul></p>

							<p><ul>Advantages:
							<li>High proportionality is possible.</li>
							<li>Competition between candidates from the same party means they can be judged on voting records.</li>
							<li>Availability of several members means constituents can choose who to take their grievances to.</li>
							</ul>
							</p>
							<p><ul>Disadvantages:
							<li>Porportionality of the outcome is varied.</li>
							<li>Strong, stable single party government is unlikely.</li>
							<li>Intra-party competition can be divisive and may allow members to evade constituency responsibilities.</li>
							</ul>
							</p>


							<h3>Party-List System</h3>
							<p>Used in: Israel, countries throughout Europe including Belgium, Luxembourg, Switzerland, and the European Parliament.<br>
							Type: Proportional <br>
							<ul>Features:
							<li>Either the entire country is a constituency, or if there are regional party lists, there are many large multimember constituencies.</li>
							<li>Parties makes lists of candidates in descending order of preference.</li>
							<li>Electors vote for parties, not candidates.</li>
							<li>Parties are allocated seats in direct proportion to their votes, with the eats filled from their party list (i.e. 5% of the vote give 5% of the seats).</li>
							<li>A threshold may be imposed to exclude small, possibly extremist parties from representation (ex: 5% in Germany).</li></ul></p>

							<p><ul>Advantages:
							<li>In theory is fair to all parties.</li>
							<li>Promotes unity by encouraging elections to identify with their nation or region rather than constituency.</li>
							<li>Easier for minority candidates to be elected if they're on the party list.</li>
							<li>Representation of many small parties ensures their is an emphasis on negotiating, bargaining, and consensus.</li>
							</ul>
							</p>
							<p><ul>Disadvantages:
							<li>Many small parties can lead to weak and unstable government.</li>
							<li>Strong, stable single party government is unlikely.</li>
							<li>Constituencies are completely unrepresented.</li>
							<li>Unpopular candidates who are well-placed on a party list can't be removed from office.</li>
							<li>Heavy party centralization. Leaders draw up party lists and junior members have to be loyal to move up the list.</li>
							</ul>
							</p>

							<h3>Election Case Study: Nazi Party Candidate Adolph Hitler</h3>
							<p>Note: Hitler did not actually win the elections, but it is an interesting case study for electoral models because it demonstrates the weaknesses of certain democratic models and how the environment surrounding elections impacts them so much.</p>
